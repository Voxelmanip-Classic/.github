Voxelmanip Classic (formerly Minecraftn't Classic) is a Minetest server that intends to recreate the simple creative freebuild gameplay that existed in Minecraft Classic.

This organisation hosts all the source code for the project, including the game that runs on the server along with the source code to the client and website.
